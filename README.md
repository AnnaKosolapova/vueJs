for compiling resources. Once you have extracted the project into a folder,
you should be able to get up and running by executing the following:

### Install project dependencies

npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```
**Tested with node v6.10.0*

```
gulp
// or
gulp watch
```

### Run local development server
